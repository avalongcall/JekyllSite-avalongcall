  <h1>ABOUT</h1>
  <p>Hello My name is Avalon Greenberg Call. I am a multidisiplenary  artist, an entertainer and visual story teller. Currently, I am a sophomore attending California Institute of the Arts for theatre and digital Arts. I have also discovered a passion for directing and producing experimental films. I have always used art as a conduit of expression, rehabilitation and education. At a very early age I was hurtled on to the stage and found a great passion for storytelling. I Began training and performing with local theatre companies in San Diego from North Coast Rep to The Old Globe Theatre. As young kid I constantly daydreamed in a bird bath of words and images I articulated into poetry. I wrote my first book in 2013, Called “The time Before Mint Peppers” published by Tebot Bach.
